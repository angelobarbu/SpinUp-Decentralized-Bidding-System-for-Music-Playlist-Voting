## Introduction

**SpinUp** is a decentralized application on the Solana blockchain, designed to allow customers in bars and clubs to bid on the next song to be played. Using SpinCoin—a custom token created on Solana—users can vote on songs from a pre-defined playlist. The song with the highest accumulated bids wins and plays next.

The application provides an engaging, gamified experience for customers and gives venue owners control over the playlist and bidding rules. SpinUp is fully decentralized, leveraging Solana’s blockchain to manage bids, votes, and transactions transparently.

### Features:
1. **Custom Token (SpinCoin)**: SpinCoin is a unique Solana-based token used for bidding.
2. **Decentralized Bidding**: Users can place bids on songs in real time, with all bids stored securely on the blockchain.
3. **Wallet Integration**: Users connect their Solana Wallets to participate, ensuring transactions are secure and transparent.
4. **Dynamic Playlist Control**: Venue owners can adjust playlists and bidding rules for each session.
